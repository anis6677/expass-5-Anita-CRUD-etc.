In this experiment have a focus on Map-Reduce. The purpose of the MapReduce operation implemented in Experiment 5 was to efficiently aggregate data using two phases: a map phase and a reduce phase.
The MapReduce operation implemented in Experiment 5 was particularly useful because it: Handled large data sets: It divided the data into smaller fragments that were processed in parallel, increasing efficiency.

The operation reduced the complexity of data processing by allowing us to focus on how data should be split and reassembled, making it easier to program and maintain.
The results from the MapReduce operation provided me with an aggregated collection that gave me a summary of the datasets. 

MapReduce is like distributed algorithm used to process and analysed large amounts of data across multiple computers.
MapReduce allows for the efficient processing of large datasets by distributing tasks across multiple nodes in a distributed system.
Complex data operations can be performed quickly, this may have contributed to the analysis and structured collection of large datasets.

Also, The goal of this assignment is to get familiar with MongoDB  and basic CRUD operations will be tested on. 
MapReduce leverages parallel processing to enhance performance, particularly with large datasets. Data can be interpreted in several ways. 

MongoDB is a document database designed for ease of development and scaling
My introduction page used on https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/introduction/ after this i install the operative system:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/
but before installing MongoDB, I validate the package using either the provided PGP signature the SHA-256 like the says in task 5. 
And i follow this tutorial to do in this page:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/verify-mongodb-packages/

Later in Experiment 1: MongoDB CRUD operations
CRUD operations stands for create, read, update, and delete documents.
I follow CRUD operations section:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/insert-documents/

after this  Experiment 2
Aggregation operations The MongoDB database provides three ways to perform aggregation: aggregation pipeline, map-reduce, and single-target aggregation methods. 
In this experiment have a focus on Map-Reduce but the results from the MapReduce operation provided me with an aggregated collection that gave me a summary of the datasets.
